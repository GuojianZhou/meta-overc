Subject: [PATCH] profile: add a tuning knob to allow sbin paths for non root

Certain commands like route, arp, ifconfig are commonly used
by non-admins, and if you come from a machine where the sbin
trio of paths are in $PATH for UID!=0, then not having them
can be frustrating.  Add a knob so that the default can be
easily changed.
